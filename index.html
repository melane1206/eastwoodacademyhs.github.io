  <p>Gardening Club</p>
  <h2>The Roots of Eastwood focus on maintaining the health of the school's gardens and educating its members on growing their own vegetation. The club meets two days a week, often focusing on planting new seeds, moving plants if necessary, and altering the new pathway we made for the students. These activities allow for members to understand how to care for plants and monitor plants' progression in different stages. Additionally, the members have grown to become more comfortable using tools like spades, shears, rakes, etc. The club doesn't particularly focus on earning money but instead collecting resources like seeds to help any flourishment.</h2>

  <p>Student Council</p>
  <h2>"My name is Maximus Arreola and I am the current president of the Class of 2026 Student Council. In my experience so far being president is like being the point man or the person people go to make the final decision. Usually when the student council meets I’ll throw in some ideas but I mainly let the others talk about what they do and then in the end if there is ever a tie in certain choices i’ll be the one to make the final decision. Also when it comes to running events or hosting town hall meetings I’ll talk about everything and what needs to be done. Being president is good for people wanting to be a leader and having the ability to encourage people to do what you want them to do for the greater good. It has been a very fun experience, definitely a big responsibility, but if your able to manage your time and be very charismatic I recommend being president is the right position for you."</h2>
