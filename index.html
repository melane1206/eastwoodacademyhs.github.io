  <p>Girls Soccer Club</p>
  <h3>The EAHS Girls Soccer Team has been around for more than nearly 20 years, even before Coach Salgado was a student here himself. After taking over the team from his former teachers - Mr. Perez and Mr. Duron - Coach Salgado has reinvented the team from the ground up to become more about "girl power". The girls soccer team is not just about playing soccer, but also about a group of young women to support and empower each other through a physically demanding and community-building sport. We combine hard, physical conditioning, and effective communication along with expressing our femininity in a sport that has been heavily male-centered for decades. Together, we celebrate our wins, stick together through losses, uplift one another after injuries, and improve as a team and as individuals in the mind, body, and soul - all while having fun on and off the practice and playing on the field. We love all the support from our friends, families, and community, and we welcome all girls of any skill level to join our family of young eager women looking to find a way to stay fit, have fun, and make friends. For more information, check us out at @eahs_wfc on Instagram!</h3>

  <p>Architect Club</p>
  <h3> It was during the club fair that Ivan and I started the Architecture Club. Although it was created on the spur of the moment, we truly made it our goal to provide interested students a taste of what college architecture students would study and construct. We have traveled to a university to view the campus's structures and architectural program. Additionally, we have given the students access to summer programs and competitions. Being an architect, Mr. Mechler gives us the chance to learn about his personal experiences as well as the advantages and disadvantages, which is a great opportunity for those who are interested. As the year progresses, Ivan and I hope to help them begin building models, assist them in entering architecture programs, and take them on more field trips to discover the many architectural styles.</h3>

 <p>Girls Volleyball Club</p>
  <h3>Although the Eastwood Volleyball team has only been around for two years, it has already fostered a strong sense of community. Being part of this team has allowed me to connect with incredible girls and has pushed me to elevate my skills. I've seen firsthand how the sport has shaped us individually and as a team creating a journey of resilience, growth, and transformation. I've not only developed as a player but also as a leader, stepping into the role of a captain. I'm incredibly proud of how far we’ve come together and I'm excited to see how the rest of the season brings along with the program.

  <p>Gardening Club</p>
  <h3>The Roots of Eastwood focus on maintaining the health of the school's gardens and educating its members on growing their own vegetation. The club meets two days a week, often focusing on planting new seeds, moving plants if necessary, and altering the new pathway we made for the students. These activities allow for members to understand how to care for plants and monitor plants' progression in different stages. Additionally, the members have grown to become more comfortable using tools like spades, shears, rakes, etc. The club doesn't particularly focus on earning money but instead collecting resources like seeds to help any flourishment.</h3>

  <p>Student Council</p>
  <h3>"My name is Maximus Arreola and I am the current president of the Class of 2026 Student Council. In my experience so far being president is like being the point man or the person people go to make the final decision. Usually when the student council meets I’ll throw in some ideas but I mainly let the others talk about what they do and then in the end if there is ever a tie in certain choices i’ll be the one to make the final decision. Also when it comes to running events or hosting town hall meetings I’ll talk about everything and what needs to be done. Being president is good for people wanting to be a leader and having the ability to encourage people to do what you want them to do for the greater good. It has been a very fun experience, definitely a big responsibility, but if your able to manage your time and be very charismatic I recommend being president is the right position for you."</h3>
